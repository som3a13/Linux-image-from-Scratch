# Build Your Own Embedded Linux System from Scratch

Welcome to the Build Your Own Embedded Linux System from Scratch project! This repository guides you through the process of building a custom embedded Linux system using Crosstool-NG, U-Boot, the Linux kernel, Device Tree Blobs (DTB), BusyBox, and an init process.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and set of scripts for building an embedded Linux system entirely from scratch. By following the steps outlined here, you'll gain a deep understanding of each component and the overall process involved in creating your custom Linux distribution tailored for embedded devices.

## Components

### Crosstool-NG

[Crosstool-NG]() is a versatile tool for building cross-compilation toolchains. It allows us to generate toolchains tailored to our specific needs, enabling us to compile software for our target architecture efficiently.

### U-Boot

[U-Boot]() is a popular bootloader used in embedded systems. It provides features such as booting the Linux kernel, initializing hardware, and providing a console for debugging and interaction.

### Linux Kernel

The [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) is the heart of any Linux-based operating system. We'll compile a kernel suitable for our target hardware, configure it according to our requirements, and generate Device Tree Blobs (DTB) for hardware abstraction.

### BusyBox

[BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/) is a collection of Unix utilities combined into a single executable. It provides essential commands typically found in standard Linux distributions but optimized for resource-constrained environments.

### Init Process

The init process is the first user-space process started during the Linux system boot process. We'll set up a minimal init process to handle system initialization tasks, such as mounting filesystems, starting system services, and launching a shell.
